    "- task: plotting gdp data on world map\n",
    "- how should I make the map world library understand countries names? --> project broken down to 2 parts (2nd part in the last module)\n",
    "1) create a dictionary that maps Pygal country codes to world bank country names\n",
    "    - i will need plot countries - dict with keys of plotting library country codes and names as values\n",
    "    - and gdp countries - dict with country names used in gdp data (we dont care about value)\n",
    "    - returns tuple containg dict and set\n",
    "    - dict maps country codes from library to country names from gdp countries\n",
    "    - set contains the country codes from plot countries that were not found in gdp countries\n",
    "2) transform gdp data for given year into a form sutiable for a world map plot\n",
    "    - 3 inputs\n",
    "    - gdpinfo dict\n",
    "    - plot countries dict\n",
    "    - year string\n",
    "    - goal is to create a dict mapping countries codes of plotting library to names of countries of the gdp data we have\n",
    "    - then we can pass it to a library, like PyGal, to pass it for visual\n",
    "    - tuple of dict and 2 sets as output\n",
    "    - dict maps country codes from plot countries to the log (base 10) of GDP value for that country in that year\n",
    "    - 1st set contains the country codes from the plot_countries that were not found in the GDP data file\n",
    "    - 2nd set containts the country codes from plot countries that were found in the data of GDP but not for that year\n",
    "3) create SVG image of the GDP data plotted on the world map\n",
    "    - 4 inputs\n",
    "    - gdpinfo dict\n",
    "    - plot countries dict\n",
    "    - year string\n",
    "    - map file\n",
    "    - no output, only svg\n",
    "- next part will be about refinning the visualization, mainly about getting the unmatched data matched"
